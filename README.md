### I'm Kierran, a undergraduate student at the university of [Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk) studying physics with advanced research. 
My coding background is simulation and data manipulation centric but I am open for collaboration on any open-source project and am keen to learn and improve my code as a whole!
